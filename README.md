# lidar-analysis

This repository contains scripts used for lidar analysis, primarily support archaeological prospection, but they are also useful for other things.

1. `hsSkymodel.py` creates (or soon will) a sky model hillshade based on Kennelly and Stewart (2014). This is a work in prgress and my first python script.
2. To be done, but will be a DEM trend removal script.
3. Positive and Negative openness
4. Sky view factor
5. TBA
